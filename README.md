Overview
Research Agent is an AI-powered system designed to assist academic and scientific research by automating literature search, paper summarization, citation management, hypothesis suggestion, and report generation. It uses natural language processing and machine learning to understand research queries and retrieve relevant information efficiently, saving researchers time and increasing research accuracy.

Features
Automated literature search across multiple academic databases

Summarization of research papers into concise insights

Organized reference and citation management

Natural language question answering for complex research topics

Hypothesis generation based on data trends and literature analysis

Draft report and research section creation

Real-time updates with latest publications and data sources

Installation
Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed

Clone the repository

Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
